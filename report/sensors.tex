In order to sail properly and make the most out of the wind that’s is supplied by the nature itself some data acquisition is needed. The sailing is all about this harnessing all the forces of the nature and the wind that it pushing towards you. Since there has not been any other extensive projects and measurements in this particular area the measurements have to be done in new ways. 

\subsection{Force sensors}

The goal here is to have a system that can measure the forces that pushes on the centerboard by the water it goes through. 
The implementation:
By looking at some different solutions there is not any other solutions that might be as clean looking and prominent as this approach. Important to know is that every solution is mandatory to be waterproof and sealed properly from the harsh environment that this system has as its home turf. The solutions that required the sensors to be mounted on the outside or in parts that would be in danger if a crash might occur was scratched.  
The board itself will not be disassembled in any major part of way. Meaning that this approach doesn’t need any modifications to the board itself. This has been the goal and the choosen approach. Modifications in the mounting plate is the way to go, the other solutions is either way more difficult to apply and mount or more complex.

\subsection{The prototype}
To implement the gauges, a prototype is designed to show how the measurements will be made. The prototype is a bit bigger than the intended solution for this project but it's good to see how it would be constructed. The function is easy to understand. The board goes on the outside and can easily slide up and down past this ball.  The ball itself is kept inside this small area where it can move in and out. The force is then measured at the back where there will be a plate. The deflection of this plate which will be the origin to the strain will be measured through strain gauges. 
The gauge itself will measure a small difference in resistance. This small difference is most likely going to be difficult to measure without any amplifying circuit connected. With a such small signal the system might have issues with noise. Another problem is that the signal might drift, and therefore make different measurements as the circuit is running. And finally, with the measured values getting amplified with a big amount the resulting signal may be off by a large amount.

\end{figure}

This way of implementing strain gauges was the first idea. 
The main case for this strategy was that in the start of this project these gauges were supplied to us, as a leftover from the last group. With this implementation, we could already start working on a prototype and get a small head start in to the project. But as some research shows, it is a more difficult way to solve this problem and it would take bit more work and some sensitive circuits to measure the force. The gauges also need to be stuck in place using some specific glue and can easily be done incorrectly and therefore prevent good measurements.

A model of the pressure sensor was constructed in the CAD program fusion 3D. This model was created in order to clearly show the function of this sensor and to help the thought process involved in the improving of this design.

\end{figure}

New idea:
A better solution is to make some research into load cells, which is a sensor which also utilizes strain gauges to measuring forces. The difference is that the gauges are already implemented in the sensor. The difference in the prototype is instead of having a metal plate, it can be built with a piece of plastic or rubber which can deform so the force is distributed directly to the sensor. By implementing this sensor, a lot of time was saved in troubleshooting. And by having a sensor unit, the modified mounting plate will be easier to produce.

\subsection{Choice of component}
The force from the board onto the mounting plate will be a considerable amount. The actual force is something that’s not known for sure. The initial assumption was that the decision of buying the right sensor we think that a sensor with a 90.75 kg force range should be enough. In the case that we max out the sensor and overload the cell it's rated for a 150\% overload without causing some damage to the sensor. 
The sensor for this application is selected to be this part, the compression load cell called FX1901. 
From the datasheet the voltage readings of this piece could be calculated. With a maximum voltage reading of around $36mV/V$

\end{figure}



\subsection{Amplifier}



That’s a small signal and needs to be amplified to get some good measurements. A good measurement signal to the MCU should be in the order of in between 0 - 5 volts. 

This is achieved by an amplification gain of around 20. 

To find some inspiration and insight about amplifiers some different applications and projects were viewed and analysed. 

In the world of amplifiers they come in almost any shape and functions, it's almost like when you are going to choose a particular transistor for a project.


By taking some inspiration from other projects a suitable amplifier was at last chosen from the vast ocean of different amplifiers. 


The choice fell on this little fellow, the INA126. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{center}
\end{figure}


Which not look so interesting but has the benefit of having a smaller power consumption then many others by being a bit simpler than many others. But sufficient for our purpose.


It seems like a smart choice because when the system is battery operated, like in this case, every watt counts.


The gain on this piece is easily calculated with this function. Gain is 5 plus 80k ohm divided by our chosen resistor Rg.


If our desired 20 gain might not work or the voltages calculated is off, the gain is easily redone with this expression.


Now that we know how to get the force measurements, we are going to talk about how to measure the frequency of waves at sea.
