As mentioned the system consists of two parts, the \gls{arm} \gls{mcu} firmware and the Android application.
Reading the sensor data in the \gls{mcu} is done with different frequencies depending on the type of sensor.
This data is computed so that is easily interpreted by the Android application.

Communication is done by the Bluetooth GATT protocol which allows the data to be sent with unique service ids to identify what type of data is sent, this also makes it possible for the data to be sent at different frequencies matching the sensor readings.
The Android application is designed for simple usage and can only be connected to a device named \emph{SailorAid}.

For more flexible usage the feedback from the sensor reading can be acquired in multiple ways.
The feedback can be received visually, by audio and by vibrations, it is also possible to close the screen and still be able to receive feedback.
The logging of data is done at the same frequency as it is received by the Bluetooth protocol.

The resulting system is created for an easy to use experience that would effortlessly be turned on and connected.
