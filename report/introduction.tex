%   Put paragraph-break before this sentence?

The art of sailing has been around for millennia. For much of human history it has been an absolutely vital part of civilization, providing efficient means of transporting goods all around the world. Today sailing has become a leisure activity enjoyed by millions of people around the world. Modern sailboats come in a large span of sizes, from large ships with crews of dozens down to small single-man dinghies. While slipping across the waves out at sea with only the wind to drive you is a calming experience, it is not a simple thing to do. When you are alone on the water, you have to be in control of the tension of the sail, the attitude of the boat, the forces on the centerboard and more while deciding how to respond to all of these. The goal of Project \emph{SailorAid} is to offload the decision-making from the sailor onto a compact, portable and simple system that will analyze these parameters and provide clear directions to the \gls{skipper}. 

% - Put this section after Physics of Sailing to give context to the goals?
% - Have goals in it's own subsection or incorperate into introduction? Or move it into Product Application?
%   And what should Product Application contain? What the product does or how it is put on the boat?
% - "The primary functional..." is too short and mechanical. Try to write something more organic later
\subsection{Goals}
The primary functional goals are the following:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep] % For consistency the item layout is reverted to standard.
	\item Boat attitude
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Implementing an appropriate \gls{imu}:
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
			\item Accelerometer
			\item Gyroscope
			\item Magnetometer
		\end{itemize}
		\item Fusing the sensor output to get an accurate estimate of boat attitude
	\end{itemize}
	\item Position tracking and velocity
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Implementing a \gls{gps} system
		\item Fusing the \gls{gps} output with the accelerometer output for more accurate positioning and velocity
	\end{itemize}
	\item Design a force measurement circuit for the centerboard
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
%		Rephrase item 1, "off the centerboard" might be ambiguous. Intent: "off" as in "not mounted on" but that feels clumsy. But "not mounted on" might work if it has been made clear earlier why we can't put it on the centerboard.
		\item Design an appropriate sensor mount off the centerboard
		\item Implement an appropriate sensor
		\item Implement a centerboard-depth sensor
	\end{itemize}
	\item  Feedback to the user of the system
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
		\item Give the user information from the sensors
		\item Display instructions to help improve the sailing experience depeding on the system state
		\item Implement different ways for the user to retrieve information
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
