The main reason for this project is to give a sailor qualitative feedback and help in clearing the mind of the techniques required to achieve a smooth sailing experience so that the sailor can focus on the joy of sailing. It is therefore crucial that the data is displayed in a manner that is easy to interpret and provide the help that is called for. To increase the flexibility of the design it was decided to implement several different user interfaces that the user could switch between while running the application. This was determined to be a good way of increasing the chances that the user would find a interface to it's liking.
